### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Caique and I'm from Belo Horizonte, Brazil.

I work as a Data Engineer at ATRA InformÃ¡tica, where I engage in both internal projects, such as workshop development, and external consulting projects in the data field.

During my undergraduate studies, I was actively involved in a junior company and had the incredible opportunity to spend a year in the United States, where I completed a Lean Enterprise course and attended two semesters at an American university. Towards the end of my undergraduate program, I developed a strong interest in the data field and began pursuing courses to deepen my knowledge.

I was honored to be a fellow in the first Data Science Fellowship in Brazil, sponsored by SIRIUS in collaboration with Ambev. During this fellowship, I delved into topics such as Python programming, data analysis and visualization, statistics, and machine learning.

My ultimate goal is to continue honing my skills in the data realm and contribute to generating insights through data analysis.
